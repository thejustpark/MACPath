Description
-----
To discover biological function of ceRNA relationship changed between normal and cancer cells, we developed a computational method (MACPath) to identify pathway pairs enriched with ceRNA relationship changes. In particular, MACPath addresses three research questions, identifying (1) direct cePathways, (2) indirect cePathways, and (3) minimally mediating ceRNAs between indirect cePathways.
